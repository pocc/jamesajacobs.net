## Key Takeaways for Site Design

1. **Expert witness services are a major gap.** 23 cases but no dedicated service listing. High-value audience (attorneys, insurers) can't find what they need.
2. **Audience self-selection is missing.** Visitors should be able to quickly identify "I'm an attorney / I'm a utility / I'm a researcher" and route themselves.
3. **Contact must be frictionless.** Every high-priority audience needs to reach James in 1-2 clicks from any page.
4. **Credentials matter.** Attorneys and regulators verify qualifications — keep post-nominals and affiliations visible.
5. **Technical depth serves consultants and academics; plain language serves property owners and communities.** The site needs both registers.
