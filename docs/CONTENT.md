### Selected Projects — Full Descriptions (from About Page)

1. **Oil and Gas Field Environmental Projects** — Performed Phase I Environmental Assessments at oil and gas production facilities. The environmental work was associated with site restoration, property transfer back to the land owners, bank refinancing and environmental regulatory responses to site conditions. Site remediation occurred on several sites. Cost estimates were prepared for settlement purposes. Assessment and remediation of hydrocarbons at hundreds of sites was designed and implemented over the past twenty years.

2. **Site Remediation and Closure** — Project Manager of dozens of underground tank removal projects. After the initial assessment, dozens of soil and groundwater remediation projects in California were performed for properties impacted with petroleum hydrocarbons or chlorinated solvents. Many of these projects were closed using in-situ remediation methods. Some of these projects used risked based corrective action (RBCA) models or risk assessment data showing limited exposures. From this approach, dozens of sites were closed.

3. **Bioremediation of Contaminated Soils** — Project manager for bioremediation of approximately 800 cubic yards of hydrocarbon-contaminated soils. Original diesel contamination exceeded 8,000 parts per million. After two months the levels of diesel in the soil were below 350 parts per million. On-site treatment lowered the disposal costs by allowing for Class III landfill disposal rates instead of Class II rates.

4. **Bioremediation of Diesel and Gasoline Contaminated Aquifer** — Developed above ground treatment equipment and supervised the installation of treatment equipment for an aerobic bioremediation treatment system for a rental car agency at the San Francisco International Airport. The treatment was part of a regulatory driven requirement on the site. Treatment of the groundwater was performed so that the treated effluent was disposed directly into the sanitary sewer.

5. **In-Situ Chemical Oxidation of Diesel Free-Product** — Directed the contracting portion of the project to inject hydrogen peroxide and acetic acid at high concentrations to remove diesel free-product near a well in Oakland, California. After the treatment event, the free product was reduced from 5 cm to 0 cm.

6. **Phase II Subsurface Investigations** — Program director and project manager responsible for dozens of Phase II subsurface investigations of commercial, agricultural, industrial and residential properties. The projects involve preparing work plans, supervising the drilling of borings and installation of Geoprobe borings and monitoring wells, well development and sampling and report preparation.

7. **Soil Remediation — San Francisco, California** — Directed removal of underground storage tanks beneath the sidewalk and undercutting a major street in the city. Subsequent remediation was required by the regulators and was designed and performed using a three-foot diameter bucket auger rig to drill out the contaminated areas adjacent to the street and over a BART tunnel. The bucket auger holes were filled immediately after being drilled with a light neat cement grout. Supervised all field activities. The client was a contractor.

8. **Underground Storage Tank Removal and Soil Remediation** — Permitted and supervised two 2,000 gallon underground storage tanks containing diesel and gasoline. After the tanks were removed, 20,000 gallons of highly contaminated water containing free product was removed from the former tank area. Soil remediation was performed by over-excavation of approximately 500 cubic yards. Reports were submitted and site closure is pending. The project from start to completion was less than two weeks. The client was a major bank.

9. **Water Procurement** — As a publicly elected official and President of the local services district board, Jacobs oversaw the purchase of irrigation water for local park facilities. Water rates at various use tiers were examined and Jacobs led the board discussion to select a favorable long-term rate schedule for irrigating the landscaping at area parks.

10. **Water Treatment Planning** — Working with the board, and the two sewer plants, Mr. Jacobs participated on the board evaluation and discussion in the negotiation of a long-term (10 year) contract with one of the treatment plants at favorable rates. Part of the agreement included a successful financing of the required improvements.

11. **Pipeline Improvement Projects and Financing** — As the president of the board of directors of the Tamalpais Community Service District, Jacobs worked with the general manager and board to prioritize the sewer repair projects on the 29-mile sewer transportation network in the district. The district and the nearby treatment plants include several pump stations and other aging facilities. Mr. Jacobs reviewed several financing options for the projects, and led the board to approve the rate hikes. Later, a $3,000,000 loan at 4.5% interest was obtained to pay for the project, allowing for a more gradual increase in the sewer rates for ratepayers.

12. **Regulatory Guidelines for Water Treatment** — As a Fulbright award winner, Mr. Jacobs taught at the University of the West Indies in Kingston, teaching a graduate class in Environmental Engineering. In addition, he taught workshops related to establishing water treatment goals in Jamaica. Participants included regulatory officials, environmental consultants, students, petroleum company employees and others. Mr. Jacobs also organized for others to participate in the teaching of the materials.

13. **In-Situ Chemical Geofixation of Chromium (VI)** — Directed and performed the contracting portion of the project to inject calcium polysulfide for chromium (VI) at a former wood treating plant in northern California. The chromated copper arsenic (CCA) chemicals found on-site included the arsenic (V) oxide, chromium (VI) oxide and copper (II) oxide used in the wood treating process. The CCA wood was used in the construction of cooling towers. Calcium polysulfide was used as the reducing agent, which successfully lowered the chromium (VI) concentration at the site over a period of 18 months.

14. **In-Situ Perchlorate Study** — Developed with the client, a field pilot study program for a rocket fuel burn test site in Hollister, California. The project was designed to inject water into the shallow vadose zone at high pressure to solubilize the perchlorate and to pump it out. The lithology at the site was clay. Groundwater was shallow (10-15 feet below ground surface). The water was injected using a high-pressure pump system connected to specialized rods driven into the ground by direct push rigs. Results indicated that although the approach was reasonable, at this site, the clays were too tight to allow for significant desorption of the perchlorate from the clay matrix.

15. **Wetlands Sampling Project** — Developed sampling plan for a wetlands sampling project and designed tooling and applications for a limited access, continuous core drilling program in a tidal wetlands. The samples included 5 soil samples to a maximum of 18 feet below ground surface and into peats and the Bay Mud to evaluate the presence of metal in the contaminated soils.

16. **Aquifer Mapping and Potentially Responsible Party Study** — Task manager for Preferred Pathways study over a two square mile industrial area at a Federal Superfund Site in Santa Clara, California. Designed the aquifer mapping study using thousands of groundwater monitoring wells and soil boring reports to define underground channel systems. The information was used to facilitate installation of remedial measures. In conjunction with the Preferred Pathways Study, a Potentially Responsible Party (PRP) study was designed and performed in the area. After evaluating over 400 businesses, a ranking system was developed. The results from the project allowed the client to try to recover some of the costs of remediation.

17. **Environmental Impact Report** — Designed and wrote the geology and hydrogeology sections of an environmental impact report for a proposed hazardous waste incineration facility in the San Francisco Bay Area. The client was a municipality.

18. **Geological Feasibility Study — King City, California** — Performed a geological feasibility study and a natural hazard assessment for an 800-acre university site. Project included compilation of historic aerial photographs, geologic and historic maps, soil surveys and previous engineering and architectural studies. The client was a private university.

19. **Subsurface Drilling Programs** — Supervised subsurface exploration drilling programs including interpretation and evaluation of data for vertical and lateral extent of contamination for hydrocarbons, volatile organic compounds and metals contamination at various sites. Designed and supervised the use of proprietary drilling tools for limited access drilling activities under canopies, in buildings, and in salt marshes. The clients include numerous consultants in the San Francisco Bay Area.

## Research: Sea Level Rise & Groundwater Flooding

### Overview
The project documents local sea level rise and climate change using real-time flood sensors, groundwater data loggers, and storm drain/sewer sensors.

### Original Prose — Full Research Description

> Sea level rise (SLR) vulnerability analysis of critical wastewater and transit infrastructure requires data collection at a temporal and geospatial scale small enough for planning and mitigation efforts. Flooding of wastewater infrastructure will increase with SLR, damaging pipes, pumps and causing sewer overflows and pipe backflows, creating human health exposure risks and environmental damage. Regular flooding of roads causes delays and damages transit infrastructure. Capital Improvement Projects (CIPs) for future wastewater and transit infrastructure projects are funded over 30-year cycles, and the next set of projects requires detailed field measurements to calculate projected SLR and groundwater flooding. SLR issues and infrastructure are discussed in [1-5]. Many general articles erroneously equate small increases in SLR with the equivalent topographic land contours. The two study areas were developed on filled wetlands along San Francisco Bay, California and have higher flood frequencies than dozens of similar nearby communities. They also reflect the intersection of areas with high flood vulnerability, with critical wastewater and transit infrastructure which fulfill Diversity, Equality and Inclusion (DEI) goals. I undertook field observations in both study areas in November and December 2020, during a period of extremely high tides (king tides), and noted groundwater flooding, stormwater backflow, surface flooding, and other associated SLR indicators that were identified and mapped.

### Study Areas

1. **Atchison Village (AV), City of Richmond, California** — A former WWII housing development, now a non-profit community with 450 units. AV is "severely economically disadvantaged," where 27% of the houses regularly have emergent groundwater in crawl spaces. AV is surrounded by industrial sites (railyards, chemical plants, and a refinery) within 1.6 km. AV is affiliated with Rosie the Riveter WWII Home Front National Historic Park. "Lake Curry" forms at the intersection of two streets during heavy storms, preventing transit through the area. The NOAA SLR Viewer shows flooding in AV at this location only after 3-feet of SLR.

2. **Tamalpais Valley (TV), Marin County** — An unincorporated area in southern Marin County that becomes impassable at the Manzanita Interchange at U.S. Route 101. Flooding is a result of a complex combination of flood actors, including high tides, heavy rains, onshore winds, and subsidence. The adjacent Fireside Apartments provides 50 affordable living units for low-income seniors and families and individuals with special needs, including those transitioning from homelessness. The Fireside Apartments reflects the "multigenerational and diverse socioeconomic character of the community."

### Research Question
How do we quantify, model and communicate the vulnerabilities of SLR and groundwater flooding on urban wastewater and transit infrastructure at a geospatial and temporal scale appropriate for local planning and mitigation?

### Goal
Collect field data, characterize subsurface preferential pathway flow, and develop a hydrogeologic model for emergent groundwater, sewer, stormdrain, and road flooding to better understand the short-term impacts of SLR. Provide real-time advance warnings to agencies and residents of impending sewer overflows and road flooding and to identify sources of floodwaters.

### Methodology — Full Detail

> Effective measurement and management of SLR, groundwater flooding, and stormwater runoff requires quantification of various flood factors of the urban coastal water balance, such as precipitation, evapotranspiration, sewer flow, stormwater flow, surface flow, tidal elevations, barometric pressure, wind direction, and other factors. The sensor/logger locations will be surveyed vertically and laterally and will lie along four to five transects and will allow for variability within each study area for elevation, surfacing, subsurface soil permeability, vegetation, flooding potential, fill history, etc. I will use real-time ultrasonic touchless sensors to measure tide levels, surface flood elevations, and flow in sewer and stormdrain pipelines. Real-time data loggers (loggers) will be installed in driven well points in utility trenches, buried stream channels and backfilled deposits (control locations). The loggers will continuously measure groundwater elevation, conductivity, temperature, pH, and other parameters. Comparison of the acquired data will help in evaluating SLR flood vulnerability of the wastewater and transit infrastructure in the two areas. The data will be evaluated using hydrogeologic models, and statistical models. A Bayesian Network will be developed as a tool for decision making.

### Methodology — 10 Task Breakdown

1. **Task 1:** Compile pre-development ecosystem, urban development history, and land subsidence data; obtain historic maps, aerial photographs, utility maps, geologic/soil maps, GIS agency maps, and topographic maps to identify sensor/logger locations.
2. **Task 2:** Locate preferential pathways for groundwater (buried stream channels, leaky sewers, utility trenches) on GIS maps.
3. **Task 3:** Install multiparameter loggers (water elevation, conductivity, temperature, pH) in driven piezometers in utility trenches, preferential pathways, and background fill (control) soil.
4. **Task 4:** Position weather stations and touchless ultrasonic meters in sewer/stormdrain manholes; install tide and stream gauges.
5. **Task 5:** Initiate public outreach and maintain data collection operations.
6. **Task 6:** Train local volunteers to assist with equipment malfunctions and document flooding with notes and photographs.
7. **Task 7:** Manage incoming data.
8. **Task 8:** Provide quarterly progress reports for public meetings and distribution on websites, newsletters, and social media.
9. **Task 9:** Review data, perform statistical analysis, develop Bayesian Network for predicting 2050, 2070, and 2100 SLR projections.
10. **Task 10:** Prepare summary reports for technical publications, government forums, and public meetings.

### Broader Impacts

> The methodology, approach, and tools developed during this research will allow wastewater and transit agencies in California and nationwide to make better choices on 30-year infrastructure plans where small-scale flood outcomes and SLR cannot be predicted with certainty. Public education, communication and outreach are an important part of the project. I have developed a public agency project leadership team specifically for my PhD project with commitments of participation from the executive director of the San Francisco Bay Area clean water agency, the mayor of the City of Richmond, the AV board of directors, the supervisor for southern Marin County, the general manager of the local sewer district (TCSD), the National Park Service, and others. The leadership team will help provide community input and valuable recommendations and their agencies will receive my progress reports, data, and findings. Public agency websites and my website (www.jamesajacobs.net) will share real-time water elevation and flood warnings with their communities. My communication plan includes project updates and results through quarterly Zoom/live meetings, publications, technical presentations, editorials, media, and social media venues. I will encourage citizen scientists to upload photos of flood events to my website.

## Research: Sewer Overflow Prediction

### Overview
Sanitary Sewer Overflows (SSOs) are discharges of raw sewage from sanitary sewer systems. SSOs can release untreated wastewater into homes, businesses, and the environment. Common causes include blockages, line breaks, sewer defects allowing infiltration and inflow, power failures, and inadequate sewer design/capacity.

### Original Prose — Full Research Description

> Sanitary Sewer Overflows (SSOs) are caused by a variety of factors and may increase with sea level rise, extreme storms, and groundwater inundation, creating health risks and environmental hazards. Evidence of groundwater inundation and sea level rise is apparent from the Tamalpais Valley, (Mill Valley), California extremely high tides (commonly called "King Tides"). Shallow groundwater, sinking surface elevation, and complex subsurface hydrogeologic conditions in urban coastal environments have created similar conditions in dozens of communities built on fill material on former wetlands along San Francisco Bay. This research pilot project proposes using a network of surveyed piezometers with battery-powered data loggers having remote telemetry system (RTS) connections to provide real-time groundwater elevation, conductivity, and temperature data in preferential pathways, such as utility trench corridors, leaky sewer pipes, and buried stream channels. The data would be compared to measurements from background areas, as well as stilling wells in creek and adjacent bay locations to measure tidal fluctuations. RTS sewage elevation and flow instruments are proposed for sewer monitoring in manholes. RTS rain gauge data will provide precipitation measurements in real-time. The data from the piezometer network, sewer instruments, stilling wells, and rain gauges would be integrated for real-time notifications (at specific sewer and groundwater elevation thresholds) to alert decision makers and emergency workers by cell phones and computers at the start of conditions which can create SSOs. A secondary use of the data would be to identify the specific cause of the potential SSOs so emergency workers can implement a rapid mitigation strategy prior to overflow of sewage-containing waters above ground surface.

## Research: Sewer Air & Vapor Intrusion

### Overview
Sewer system pipes are a potential alternate exposure pathway for toxic sewer gases and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) to migrate into indoor air.

### Original Prose — Technical Background

> Sewer system pipes are a potential alternate exposure pathway for toxic sewer gases and volatile organic compounds (VOCs) like benzene in gasoline, and tetrachloroethylene (PCE), a common dry cleaning solvent, to migrate into indoor air. A common US EPA (2002) vapor intrusion model needs to be re-evaluated and updated to include this important exposure pathway, especially in buildings located upgradient and outside of mapped groundwater contaminant plumes containing VOCs. The US EPA (2002) and other regulatory agencies use various vapor intrusion prediction models to make risk-based environmental decisions, including the commonly used model by Johnson and Ettinger (1991). VOC-impacted groundwater can infiltrate into cracked and leaking sewer trunk lines. The VOC volatilizes into sewer air and migrates through the sewer system into the indoor air in houses which have inadequate vapor seals.

> There are hundreds of thousands of shallow groundwater plumes containing VOC in urban areas in North America. There are also countless urban sewer systems which leak significantly during strong rain events. The research is focused on studying the migration of VOCs into indoor air through legacy sewer-plumbing systems and ineffective vapor seals and are planning to document the extent to which VOC vapors migrate within sewer pipes located upgradient and outside of delineated VOC groundwater plume areas.

### Legacy Sewer and Plumbing Systems — Full Context

> Many urban sewer systems in North America are more than 100 years old and are well past their design life. The legacy sewer mains and associated laterals and components frequently subside, fail, and develop cracks or separations over time. These are evidenced as breaches in the concrete, clay or transite pipes or corrosion in cast iron pipes. Tree and plant roots commonly damage sewer pipe integrity. Legacy sewer system pipes experience infiltration of groundwater during the rainy season. Inflow and infiltration (I&I) during significant rain events in a northern California collection system was shown to contribute 8 to 33 times the amount of daily sewer flow shortly after a downpour. Diurnal base wastewater flow (BWF) shows increased flow in the early morning hours and during dinner through evening hours. Groundwater infiltration (GWI) into sewer pipes is relatively constant during a 24-hour period in an area with no tidal influences.

> Within structures, ineffective vapor seals in plumbing systems in buildings (dry P-Traps, breached toilet wax rings, cracked plumbing drain pipes, loose fittings and gaskets, for example) are common. When breached sewer collection pipes intersect contaminated soil and groundwater containing VOCs, the potential for VOC-containing water and VOC-containing vapor to infiltrate into breached sewer pipes is high. While VOC-containing fluids are conveyed downgradient in the sewer pipes toward the wastewater treatment plant, the VOCs in groundwater, pipe debris/solids and soil vapor naturally volatilizes and migrates in the sewer pipes. VOCs in vapor form (sewer air) migrates without specific regard to gravity. Sewer air, which migrates throughout the system, frequently contains sewer gases such as methane, ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, and low levels of carbon dioxide and any other volatile compounds.

### How It Works (3-Step Process)
1. **Step 1 — Contamination Source:** VOCs enter the sewer from contaminated groundwater or soil gas through cracked or damaged sewer pipes, joints, and manholes.
2. **Step 2 — Sewer Transport:** VOCs travel through the sewer system, potentially migrating far from the original contamination source, transported by sewer air currents.
3. **Step 3 — Building Entry:** VOCs enter buildings through compromised plumbing fixtures, dried-out P-traps, cracked drain pipes, and unsealed utility penetrations.

### Building Conditions Assessment Matrix
- **Complete Pathway — Sewer Defects + Plumbing Defects:** High risk of vapor intrusion. Both sewer system and building plumbing compromised.
- **Incomplete Pathway — Sewer Intact + Plumbing Defects:** Moderate risk. Building has plumbing issues but sewer line is intact.
- **Incomplete Pathway — Sewer Defects + Plumbing Intact:** Lower risk. Contaminated sewer air present but building plumbing provides barrier.
- **No Pathway — Sewer Intact + Plumbing Intact:** Minimal risk. Both systems functioning properly.

> Two recent PCE-specific vapor intrusion studies documented significant indoor air contributions of PCE from the plumbing-sewer systems located within PCE groundwater plume areas; the PCE groundwater plumes studied were in Skuldelev, Denmark (Riis et al., 2010) and in Boston, Massachusetts (Pennell et al., 2013). In both studies, PCE vapors were found in indoor air and were tracked back to sewer-plumbing systems which intersected a delineated PCE groundwater plume. In both cases, the concentrations of PCE detected inside the buildings were orders of magnitude higher than the levels generally considered safe for long-term indoor air exposure. In the Denmark study (Riis et al., 2010), PCE was reported in indoor air near the drain under a kitchen sink as high as 810 µg/m3. In the Boston study, concentrations of PCE in isolated bathroom air was 2.1 µg/m3. When the sewer connection for the toilet in the bathroom was open to indoor air, the inside air had a PCE concentration of 62 µg/m3 to 190 µg/m3.

> For the Massachusetts Department of Environmental Protection (MassDEP), the threshold value for PCE is 1.4 μg/m3. Using the California Department of Toxic Substances Control (DTSC, 2014) Human and Ecological Risk (HERO) recommended values for PCE concentrations for residential air screening levels calculated using the Regional Screening Level (RSLs) calculator are 0.41μg/m3 for cancer and 37μg/m3 for non-cancer risk. San Francisco Bay Regional Water Quality Control Board (RWQCB, 2013) Environmental Screening Levels (ESLs) for PCE in indoor air (residential) is 0.41 μg/m3.

### Research Objectives
1. Working with local sewer agencies, document the presence of PCE outside the groundwater plume area and verify exposure vulnerability of upgradient occupants
2. Screen and sample iteratively in sewer manholes and cleanouts for sewer gases and PCE in systems intercepting known groundwater PCE plumes
3. Sample indoor air within accessible buildings in basements or crawl spaces, at each floor, and near vapor seals (bathrooms and kitchens)
4. Inspect and document plumbing fixtures and condition of vapor seals in buildings where PCE detections are observed
5. Develop screening tools for regulatory agencies
6. Create guidance documents for building inspectors and regulators

## Research: Wetlands — Wastewater Treatment Farm Concept

### Vision — Original Prose

> The local wastewater treatment plant which has long been stigmatized due to the strong stench on a hot summer day must be reconsidered as a respectable member of society: as a resource recycling facility. As a commissioner of a local sewerage agency since 2002, I have long been interested in rethinking raw sewage as an unsightly and smelly waste product to a more dignified source of raw materials for other products and ecoservices.

### Project Concept

> Constructed wetlands can become resource recovery centers and food, non-food, clean water farms and biogas generators. The optimum location for the constructed wetlands water project would be in a developing nation having unmet challenges with untreated human waste or polluted stormwater and a need for sustainable local agriculture and water recycling. The good news for this type of project is that there are plenty of available project locations which need low-cost, safe and healthy sanitary waste treatment services. Funding is needed for the design and implementation of a wastewater treatment farm.

> This fascinating technical challenge requires the optimization of a natural wastewater treatment design based on low-cost and sustainability criteria to produce food, other non-food products, and biogas while treating wastewater. The project involves significant research, a multidisciplinary approach and team input on risk-feedback loops to guarantee safe and healthy food and non-food items produced at a wastewater treatment farm.

### 8 Possible Products

> The water treatment farm designed for treating wastewater and underlying pond sediment produces a variety of renewable and sustainable food and non-food products: brush, shrubs or fast growing trees to harvest for timber or weaving materials, ornamental plants and flowers, fuel and animal feed from algae, fruits and vegetables, and reusable water. Fish and shellfish from aquaculture operations and captured biogas as an energy source can also be produced. The water treatment farm generates local jobs, and creates habitat and will serve to attract wildlife and tourists as an education demonstration project.

1. **Treated Water** — For irrigation, groundwater recharge, or wetland habitat
2. **Biogas** — Methane from anaerobic digestion for energy
3. **Compost** — From biosolids processing
4. **Aquaculture** — Fish and shellfish in treated water polishing ponds
5. **Biomass** — Harvested wetland plants (brush, shrubs, fast-growing trees) for timber, weaving materials, bioenergy feedstock
6. **Algae Products** — Fuel and animal feed from algae cultivation
7. **Education & Jobs** — Field studies, training programs, local employment
8. **Habitat** — Wildlife and waterfowl habitat; tourism attraction

### Background — Precedents

> Wastes can be reframed as reusable resources. Water reuse of acid mine drainage and municipal wastewater has been demonstrated. Fish biologist Ken Semmens, Ph.D. used treated mine drainage for producing yellow perch, striped bass and three kinds of trout in West Virginia, Maryland, and Pennsylvania in the eastern United States. Constructed wetlands also provide value in treating mining wastes and acid mine drainage. Resource recovery evaluations even at U.S. EPA Superfund sites, such as the Iron Mountain Mine Site near Mount Shasta, California are worthwhile. Iron Mountain is an infamous US EPA Superfund Site known for historic acid mine drainage and massive fish kills. Developing nations or specific sites with mining wastes in the developed provide opportunities to use constructed wetlands as resource recycling and recovery centers. In addition, programs to minimize wastes and lower water consumption are part of a large-scale regional sustainability strategy.

## Research: Safe Water in Rural India

### Overview — Original Prose

> India has the second largest population on Earth with more than 1 billion people. About half of India's population, 522 million, practice open defecation. The World Bank estimates that 21 percent of communicable diseases in India are linked to unsafe water and the lack of proper hygiene practices. In addition, more than 500 children under the age of five years old die each day from diarrhea in India alone. Over 163 million people in India lack access to safe water and 201 million people in India lack access to improved sanitation. There is a water and sanitation crisis in India.

### Project Description

> The proposed project is to teach graduate geology and environmental science students in the class-room and in the field to inspect rural water supply wells, and with the goal of helping farmers rehabilitate and seal water wells worthy of repair and to develop groundwater management plans near water supply wells.

> The Lecturer will provide class-room workshops on basic water well design, and well head protection measures for graduate students at SRTM University that will be performed at selected well locations in Maharashtra, India. Part of the project will be to train geology graduate geology students as teachers to instruct local farmers on best groundwater protection practices. The project will explore through a literature research phase of activity the impacts and drivers of agricultural and industrial land degradation and climate-change factors related to degraded well water quality. The workshop will feature the basics components of a groundwater management plan for a selected sub-basin within Maharashtra. Field studies will feature actual well inspections with graduate students, well head mitigation design, and implementation (if possible), mapping of agricultural/industrial and climate-change drivers such as more intense flooding and agricultural/industrial runoff near the selected wells, and methodologies to improve water quality in historic wells.

### Host University
SRTM University, Nanded, India

### Study Area — Kadava River Sub-Basin

> The Kadava River Sub-Basin is a good example of a region with water quality issues. The sub-basin drains into the Godavari River in Maharashtra, India. Most farmers in the rural area rely on hand-dug water supply wells, some which are hundreds of years old and lack even basic well head protection or surface seals. The general geology is characterized by younger and older flood plains, with the late Cretaceous Deccan Plateau basalts at various geomorphic plateaus. The Deccan basalts represent one of the largest volcanic features on Earth and feature fractured bedrock aquifers.

### Water Sampling Parameters
Water parameters discussed in class and collected in the field: general minerals (Ca, Mg, Na, K, Cl, SO4, NO3, F), total hardness, total dissolved solids, dissolved oxygen, oxidation-reduction potential (Redox), pH, temperature, conductivity, e. coli, and total coliform. Pre-well head mitigation and post-well head mitigation water samples collected to evaluate success of the groundwater management plan. Samples collected during post-monsoon seasons.

### Methodology

> Hand-dug wells in the area show the lack of basic surface protection or sanitary seals to keep surface contaminants from entering the water supply wells. The proposed work addresses training graduate students in water protection theory so they can teach local farmers about groundwater protection in rural areas and mitigation measures such as proper well retrofits, which can be used to improve groundwater quality. The teaching will develop an India-specific inspection methodology and checklist which will help guide field decisions along with existing laboratory analytical results. It may be that some hand-dug wells will be deemed unsuitable for domestic consumption and not worthy of rehabilitation and repair.

## Geology & Beer

### Full Essay (Original Prose)

> If I tell you that as a groundwater geologist, a 6% alcohol by volume beer has 94% water and that water must be studied with great gusto, I am sure you would agree. It turns out that because the Romans and the Greeks before them used lined street ditches as sewers to remove human wastes from the urban areas, we now have historic brewery styles as distinctive as pilsners are from stouts. It all relates to groundwater.
>
> The Greeks and Romans conceptualized about water resources and wastewater treatment in a centralized model - the water would be brought to the center city for local distribution, and the wastes would be generated in public toilets, and the pipes and open-channel sewers would lead to the river in a centralized discharge point. By allowing the Tiber River in Rome to become contaminated with human and animal wastes, the river became unusable as a source of potable water. Therefore, clean drinking water had to be brought in from far away. This was accomplished by the great Roman aqueducts and other engineering feats. Importing water to the center of Rome had the effect of centralizing water resources. Had the Romans kept the Tiber River clean, who knows whether we would have decentralized urban water and sewer systems today.
>
> Later, Europeans in England, Belgium, Germany and other beer drinking countries realized their waterways were too polluted to drink or use the water as brewing water, and most brewers preferred to use cleaner groundwater sources accessed through hand-dug wells. The water was much cleaner and contained local dissolved minerals which reflected geologic processes of deposition of the rocks in which the water flowed. In some cases, clean sandstone aquifers provided sand-filtered water of the highest quality. High sulfate levels in some groundwaters (think Burton-upon-Trent) indicates a source of gypsum, and evaporative depositional processes in the past.
>
> One last thing about centralized versus decentralized water and wastewater services - decentralized distribution of water and wastewater services in urban areas would have required individual hand-dug water wells and individual latrines or out houses. The Greeks and Romans thought about these issues and both agreed on the centralized approach for water and wastewater services in urban settings. The centralized model for water and wastewater is still with us today in the urban centers over 2,000 years later. Rural areas have tended to go with a decentralized model. Future wastewater and water will likely require a combination of water recycling in urban homes or small communities and possibly some limited onsite treatment of wastewater. With sea level rise, we will need to rethink the coastal wastewater plants and the water sources.
>
> Coming back to beer - the historic brewing styles in Europe reflect the decisions of thousands of brew masters working over hundreds of years with the specific groundwater at their brewery. These brewing chemists had to adjust their hops, yeasts, and cereal grains to the dissolved minerals, pH and other characteristics in the brewing water to yield a consistently tasty brew that locals would reliably purchase year after year. Having brewed a few batches, I understand how challenging it is for brewmasters to consistently deliver a terrific beer. I have attached as a PDF a list of beer and geology references plus a portion of my beer and geology lecture. Cheers!

### Essay Themes
- **The Roman Connection** — Ancient Romans' centralized water/sewer decisions shaped European brewing history
- **Centralized vs. Decentralized** — How the Greek/Roman centralized model persists 2,000+ years later
- **Water-Beer Connection** — Groundwater mineral content (sulfate, gypsum) directly influenced regional beer styles (e.g., Burton-upon-Trent)
- **Brewing Tradition** — Thousands of brewmasters over hundreds of years adapting to local groundwater chemistry
- **Future Outlook** — Sea level rise will force rethinking of coastal wastewater and water supply infrastructure

## Services

### Overview — Original Prose

> In the digital age, we are more connected than we ever thought possible. Our connections also relate to old technologies, such as sewers. Sewers connect us in a way that was not considered decades ago when vapor intrusion models were developed, and consequently, VOCs in sewer air are free to enter buildings when vapor seals and plumbing fixtures are compromised. Buildings might contain a musty, moldy or rotten-egg odor which could indicate degraded indoor air quality. Toilets which wobble even a small amount can indicate a compromised vapor seal on a toilet wax ring. Water traps that dry out from lack of use (basement P-traps or unused bathrooms) can allow sewer air into occupied spaces. Leaking plumbing fixtures and loose or cracked fittings can contribute to sewer air entering occupied spaces.

### Service Categories

1. **Sewer Air Testing Services** — Individual buildings are tested after a site inspection defines plumbing layout and utility conduit locations. Air sampling varies, but can include the use of a variety of vapor meters, sorbent tube samplers, active samplers and passive samplers to evaluate whether sewer air is entering an occupied space. If sewer air is entering an occupied space, the concentrations and composition of the contaminants in the sewer air can be identified, and mitigation measures can be implemented.

2. **Legacy Sewer and Groundwater Plume Intersection Mapping Studies** — Provides regulatory agencies, sewer agencies and others a map of the condition of sewer lines based on video camera inspection and smoke testing, overlain with maps of known soil contamination and groundwater plumes. These studies allow agencies to prioritize sewer replacement projects, which typically are multi-million dollar capital improvement projects. Mitigation measures in occupied buildings are also performed.

3. **Workshops and Training** — Clearwater Group has developed workshops and training regarding sewer air investigations and sampling methods for sewer districts, consultants or regulatory agencies.

4. **Cost Allocation Studies** — Typical of urban sewer agencies with legacy systems which are impacted by industrial contaminants, Clearwater Group provides sewer agencies or regulatory agencies independent cost allocation services to address cost sharing of sewer air mitigation measures. The firm also provides information to help sewer agencies to define responsibilities of the potentially responsible parties (PRPs) for the contaminants in the sewer systems.

5. **Community Support Services** — Sewer air contaminated with volatile industrial compounds can be an issue of environmental justice, as a disproportionate number of low-income, frequently minority residents live near industrial urban areas with impacted soil and groundwater. Clearwater Group provides public outreach and community communication regarding environmental issues, building inspections for sewer air intrusion into occupied structures, sewer air sampling design, and if exposure issues are discovered, design and implementation of mitigation measures.
