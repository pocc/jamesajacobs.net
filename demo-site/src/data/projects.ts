        details:
            'After initial assessment, dozens of soil and groundwater remediation projects in California were performed for properties impacted with petroleum hydrocarbons or chlorinated solvents. Many projects were closed using in-situ remediation methods. Some used risk-based corrective action (RBCA) models or risk assessment data showing limited exposures. From this approach, dozens of sites were closed.',
