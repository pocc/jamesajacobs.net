        title: 'Coastal Erosion and Sea Level Rise Assessment, San Francisco Bay',
        summary:
            'Led multi-year assessment of coastal erosion hazards and sea level rise impacts along the San Francisco Bay shoreline, developing adaptation strategies for critical infrastructure.',
        details:
            'The project involved detailed geomorphological mapping, tide gauge analysis, and LiDAR-derived elevation modeling to project future inundation zones under multiple IPCC scenarios. Recommendations included nature-based solutions such as living shorelines and managed retreat planning for vulnerable areas. Partnered with NOAA California Sea Grant and local municipalities.',
    },
    {
        title: 'MTBE Groundwater Contamination Forensic Analysis',
        summary:
            'Conducted forensic geochemistry analysis to identify sources of MTBE contamination in a multi-party groundwater plume affecting municipal water supply wells.',
        details:
            'Used compound-specific isotope analysis (CSIA) and multivariate statistical methods to differentiate MTBE sources from multiple petroleum release sites. Expert witness testimony was provided in subsequent litigation. The investigation supported remedial action decisions and allocation of cleanup costs among responsible parties.',
    },
    {
        title: 'Sanitary Sewer Overflow Monitoring Program, Northern California',
        summary:
            'Designed and implemented a real-time sewer overflow detection and monitoring system for a Northern California wastewater utility serving 200,000+ residents.',
        details:
            'Deployed SmartCover flow monitoring sensors at 45 critical manholes with telemetry to a cloud-based dashboard for real-time alerts. The program reduced SSO events by over 60% in the first year through early detection and predictive analytics for capacity-related overflows during wet weather events.',
    },
    {
        title: 'Acid Mine Drainage Remediation, Sierra Nevada Foothills',
        summary:
            'Managed remediation of acid mine drainage from a historic gold mining site contaminating a perennial creek and downstream wetlands.',
        details:
            'Designed a passive treatment system using successive alkalinity producing systems (SAPS) and constructed wetlands to neutralize acidic drainage and remove dissolved metals. Post-construction monitoring demonstrated consistent compliance with water quality objectives for pH, copper, zinc, and iron over a three-year period.',
    },
    {
        title: 'Vapor Intrusion Investigation, Former Dry Cleaner Site',
        summary:
            'Investigated vapor intrusion of chlorinated solvents into occupied commercial buildings overlying a PCE groundwater plume from a former dry cleaning facility.',
        details:
            'Implemented a phased investigation including sub-slab soil gas sampling, indoor air monitoring, and groundwater characterization. Identified preferential vapor migration pathways through utility corridors and sewer laterals. Recommended and designed a sub-slab depressurization system that reduced indoor air concentrations below screening levels.',
    },
    {
        title: 'Wetland Restoration, South San Francisco Bay Salt Ponds',
        summary:
            'Contributed geological and hydrogeological expertise to the restoration of former industrial salt evaporation ponds to tidal wetland habitat.',
        details:
            "Provided sediment characterization, groundwater-surface water interaction analysis, and geotechnical evaluation of levee breaching plans. The project restored over 200 acres of tidal marsh habitat, supporting endangered species recovery including the Ridgway's rail and salt marsh harvest mouse.",
