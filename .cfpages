# Cloudflare Pages Configuration
# This file is not used by Cloudflare, but documents the correct settings

# Build Settings (configure in Cloudflare Dashboard):
# - Build command: npm run build
# - Build output directory: dist
# - Root directory: (leave blank)
# - Environment variables: none needed for static build

# DO NOT set a "deploy command" - Pages will automatically serve the dist folder
